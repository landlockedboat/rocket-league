This Low Poly Car Pack contains a yellow car (with separate wheels) which has been textured, UV mapped, and unwrapped. The mesh and texture (after compression) are very small and can be used in a street racing game. The asset can be easily imported into Unity or an open-source game engine like Superpowers

UPDATE: Version 1.2
Added white sedan mesh and texture to asset pack

Why Early Access?

I have been making game assets for over the last decade for various team. These are game dev teams that I work with on a daily basis. The project has a certain level of expectation and as a team, we work towards delivering a quality product. Feedback during development cycles are quick and iterative and that keep the entire process of build games moving forward, like a well oiled machine.

Over the last few months I've started working on making games for the community here at itch.io. With each new release pack, I tend to get contacted by developers who want new assets with a certain game pack. The whole process of building, releasing, getting feedback, and releasing again is a very slow development. Early access allows me to get feedback from developers / clients during and before launch. This means the end product is a lot more tailored to the community's needs.

Funds earned by generous donors help expand the team and get one more artist on board to help make assets faster. The quicker you get new quality assets.

If you like these assets, or have a specific art asset need, please do leave a comment on the store :)

Cheers!
